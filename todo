(not complete)
- find optimal game loop time
- collision detection
- ball velocity needs to remain constant when moving on x and y
    probably need to change refresh rate for ball position to achieve this
    if ball is moving in both directions, change its position at a rate of 1/sqrt(2)
- 
k



(done)
- limit input buffer to 1
